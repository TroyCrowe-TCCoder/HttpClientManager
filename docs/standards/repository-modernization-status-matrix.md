# Repository Modernization Status Matrix

## Repository
- Name: HttpClientManager
- Last updated: 2026-03-30
- Scope: In-scope modernization candidate

## Summary
Shared standards baseline applied. The repository still needs repo-specific deviations, tests, and CI/CD automation before deeper modernization can be considered complete.

## Status Matrix
| Area | Status | Evidence | Next focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standards and instructions | Partial | Shared docs/standards assets are present, but .github/copilot-instructions.md still contains template placeholders. | Replace placeholders with meaningful repository-specific deviations. |
| Structure and naming | Partial | Detected project count: 1. | Review solution and project naming, then confirm structure by concern. |
| Configuration and secrets | Needs review | Standards rollout completed, but repo-specific config review has not yet been completed. | Audit configuration sources, strongly typed options usage, and secret management. |
| Security and authorization | Needs review | Repo-specific auth and tenant rules still need review against the checklist. | Review auth flow, policy centralization, tenant isolation, and validation. |
| Testing and quality | Not started | Detected test project count: 0. | Add or expand unit and integration/contract tests. |
| Observability and diagnostics | Needs review | No repo-specific diagnostics review has been recorded yet. | Review logging, correlation, health endpoints, error handling, traces, and metrics. |
| Performance and resilience | Needs review | No repo-specific resilience review has been recorded yet. | Review async usage, streaming, timeout/retry rules, caching, and performance budgets. |
| CI/CD and delivery | Not started | Detected pipeline/workflow count: 0. | Add or improve build, test, and deployment automation. |

## Immediate Next Actions
1. Complete .github/copilot-instructions.md with repository-specific deviations.
2. Review this repository against docs/standards/repository-modernization-checklist.md.
3. Record the first modernization slice for architecture, testing, observability, and CI/CD.
